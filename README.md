DNA-Sequencer
========================

This program will effectively sequence a randomly generated DNA strand in the input1.txt file.

Procedure:
1.) Create a local directory named "DNAtoProtein" in you C: drive. (I will implement a configurable directory soon)
2.) Copy and paste the code in the DNA-RNA-Protein.java class into your project.
3.) Add the API's and the corresponding libraries from their corresponding websites. They simply provide utilities for BufferedWriter and LineReader.
4.) Export the project as a RUNNABLE JAR to whatever destination.
5.) Double click and follow the steps!

Upcoming:
1.) Configurable main directory
2.) Choose between sequencing random and custom DNA sequences
3.) Java GUI using JFrame rather than JOptionPane... (looks terrible)

I originally made this small program during my summer program at the Anschutz Medical campus in Denver, Colorado.
