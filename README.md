DNA-Sequencer
========================

This program will effectively sequence a randomly generated DNA strand in the RandomDNA.txt file. DNA strands are generated randomly. Once generated, the DNA strands will be transcribed into RNA and the RNA strands will be stored in the mRNA.txt file. Once mRNA is generated, the final protein sequence will be generated in the ProteinSequence.txt file.




Procedure:
1.) Create a local directory named "DNAtoProtein" in you C: drive. (I will implement a configurable directory soon)
2.) Copy and paste the code in the DNA-RNA-Protein.java class into your project.
3.) Add the API's and the corresponding libraries from their corresponding websites. They simply provide utilities for BufferedWriter and LineReader.
4.) Export the project as a RUNNABLE JAR to whatever destination.
5.) Double click and follow the steps!

Upcoming:
1.) Configurable main directory
2.) Choose between sequencing random and custom DNA sequences
3.) Java GUI using JFrame rather than JOptionPane... (looks terrible)

I originally made this small program during my summer program at the Anschutz Medical campus in Denver, Colorado.
